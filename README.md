# hashmap
Hash Map Data Structure that uses a dynamic array to store hash table and implement chaining for collision resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key/value pairs are stored in linked list nodes.
Methods include returning number of empty buckets, load factor, clear contents, update key, value pairs, search for key, remove key/value pair, resize table and returns all keys stored in hash map. 
Purposely avoided Python built in methods for practice reasons.
